# Hi, I'm Nikola

\
Welcome to my world of quality assurance and software testing! I've embarked on an exciting journey in the realm of quality assurance, wearing the hat of a QA engineer for several years now. Within my company, I've taken on a role that's dear to my heart – that of a tech core and mentor, guiding and mentoring fellow enthusiasts in the ever-evolving field of software testing.

The creation of this site stems from a deep-seated passion to share my knowledge and insights with a wide-ranging audience. As my expertise continues to expand, my mission is to demystify complex topics and bring them closer to you, making them accessible and understandable. Before we dive deeper into the fascinating world of software testing, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude for joining me on this journey – your presence here is truly invaluable.

If you've already embarked on your own QA career path, you're well aware that this field demands constant self-improvement and an unquenchable thirst for new knowledge. It's a realm where adaptability and a quest for excellence are the guiding stars. And if you're still exploring your place in this dynamic world, fret not – my blogs are designed to be a stepping stone, a platform for you to spring into action.

Now, a little about my own journey. My foray into the IT universe began with the enigmatic world of C programming. From there, I delved into a year-long course in Java development, where software testing was merely a passing topic. Unit testing? Yes, that's the beginning, but we won't dwell on it here. It was a friend who introduced me to the transformative realm of ITBootcamp, where I had the privilege of learning from some truly exceptional individuals in the QA field. Upon completing the course, I was given the golden opportunity to embrace my first job as a QA engineer, and my journey only intensified from there.

Yet, my thirst for knowledge knew no bounds. This insatiable curiosity led me to explore further, and I found myself pursuing a vocational path in Electrical and Computer Engineering. As I stand today, with a background in both programming and QA, I'm thrilled to have you join me on this quest for knowledge, where we'll unravel the mysteries of software testing and quality assurance, one blog post at a time.
