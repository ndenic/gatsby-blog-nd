# Hi, I'm Nikola

Welcome to the world of quality assurance and software testing! I'm a seasoned QA engineer, and within my company, I play the roles of tech lead and mentor, guiding fellow enthusiasts in the dynamic realm of software testing.

This site is my platform to share my knowledge with a diverse audience. As my expertise grows, I aim to simplify complex topics and bring them closer to you. Thank you for being here â€“ your presence means a lot as we delve into the exciting world of software testing.

Whether you're already on a QA career path or just exploring it, my blogs are your stepping stone.

My journey began with C programming, followed by a Java development course that briefly touched on testing. It was a friend who introduced me to ITBootcamp, where I learned from QA experts. With a job as a QA engineer, I wanted more, so I ventured into Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Join me in this quest for knowledge as we unravel the world of software testing, one blog post at a time.
