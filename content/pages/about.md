# Hi, I'm Nikola

**I have been working as a QA engineer for few years and in my company I work as a tech core/mentor.With this site, I wanted to make it for a wide audience, and as my knowledge grows, I will bring some of the topics closer to you.
First of all, let me thank you for coming all the way here, and that's a lot for a start.** 


If you have already started your career in the QA world, I can tell you that you have chosen a path where it is necessary to constantly improve yourself and strive for new knowledge. And if you are not yet and you are trying to find yourself in this world, I think these blogs will be a good springboard for you.


Let's get back to the topic a little bit about myself.
I found my way in the IT world mainly through QA work. Actually, at the beginning I started with the C programming language, after that a one-year course in Java development where testing was only a passing topic. And what kind of testing is that? Of course unit :) Which I will not deal with here. After that a friend recommended me ITBootcamp where I got the opportunity to learn from great people all about QA. After completing the course, I got the opportunity and my first job as a QA engineer. All that was not enough for me, so I ended up as
Vocational in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
